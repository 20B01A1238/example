                <h1>GODAVARI</h1>
                <p>The river has been revered in Hindu scriptures for many millennia and continues to harbour and
                    nourish a rich cultural heritage. In the past few decades, the river has been barricaded by several
                    barrages and dams, keeping a head of water (depth) which lowers evaporation. Its broad river delta
                    houses 729 persons/km2 nearly twice the Indian average population density and has a substantial risk
                    of flooding, which in lower parts would be exacerbated if the global sea level were to rise. Nearly
                    50% of the water availability is being harnessed. The water allocation from the river among the
                    riparian states are governed by the Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal. The river has highest flood
                    flows in India and experienced recorded flood of 3.6 million cusecs in the year 1986 and annual
                    flood of 1.0 million cusecs is normal. </p><br>

                <h1>GANGES</h1>
                <p>The Ganges is a lifeline to millions of people who live in its basin and depend on it for their
                    daily needs.[13] It has been important historically, with many former provincial or imperial
                    capitals such as Pataliputra,[14] Kannauj,[14] Kara, Munger, Kashi, Patna, Hajipur, Delhi,
                    Bhagalpur, Murshidabad, Baharampur, Kampilya, and Kolkata located on its banks or the banks of
                    tributaries and connected waterways. The river is home to approximately 140 species of fish, 90
                    species of amphibians, and also reptiles and mammals, including critically endangered species
                    such as the gharial and South Asian river dolphin.[15] The Ganges is the most sacred river to
                    Hindus.[16] It is worshipped as the goddess Ganga in Hinduism.The Ganges is threatened by severe
                    pollution. This poses a danger not only to humans but also to animals. </p><br><br>

                <h1>KRISHNA</h1>
                <p>The Krishna river originates in the Western Ghats near Mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about 1,300
                    metres (4,300 ft), in the state of Maharashtra in central India. The Krishna river is around 1,400
                    kilometres (870 mi) in length (282 kilometres (175 mi) in Maharashtra). It is one of the most
                    suitable arable basins in the world as 75.6% of the Krishna basin is under cultivation due to the
                    availability of water. The river's source is at Mahabaleshwar near Jor village in the extreme north
                    of Wai Taluka, Satara District, Maharashtra in the west, and it empties into the Bay of Bengal at
                    Hamasaladeevi (near Koduru) in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast. The river flows through the state
                    of Karnataka before entering Telangana state. The delta of this river is one of the most fertile
                    regions in India and was home to the ancient Satavahana and Ikshvaku Sun Dynasty kings. Vijayawada
                    and Sangli are the largest cities on the Krishna.</p>
